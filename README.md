I start my journey in 2019 starting watch video toking about programming and I sad how amazing it this, just
some letters and words I can control the computer from where I sit I can get all kinds of information and build
a huge business, so I start learning the first language is one of most powerful languages it's c++ then I convert
to python and it just very fun lovely language and applying what I learn to build some games like (x,o) and
pong game and guessing game but I noticed that all just a language I can't work like these so I go to the web
development world and start from September 2020 and learn HTML then CSS from Codecademy and Udacity
and youtube applying what I learned in projects then I learn JS it's was so easy cause I have some experience
in programming, I did some games with it like (rock, paper, scissors),(blackjack) and some little programs like
(your age in days), (IMG generator), change the color of all buttons) and here I am.
